    The algorithm randomly changes the values of variables in selected records (usually the risky ones) according
    to an invariant probability transition matrix or a custom-defined transition matrix.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : pandas.DataFrame
        The data to be modified.
    perturb_cols : List, Optional (Default: None)
        The subset of columns that will be manipulated from `data`. The values of `data[perturb_cols]`
        must be categorical, or able to be cast as categorical, and there can be no overlapping columns
        with `sensitive_col`. If omitted, all columns of `data` will be perturbed.
    sensitive_col : str (Default: None)
        Column whos relationship to other columns needs to be obfuscated.
        If defined, then only the columns specified in `perturb_cols` will be modified.
        There can be no overlapping columns with `perturb_cols`.
    probs: float, int, dict (Default: 0.8)
        Probabilities to use when calculating the transition matrix. If `probs` is a float or int,
        then it must be between the interval [0,1] and it will be used as a lower bound probability
        that a categorical value will *not* change. Thus, if `probs` is 1, then there will *not* be
        any change in the categorical values, and if `probs` is 0, then there is a high probability
        that a categorical value will change. If `probs` is a dict, then it should contain the
        transition probabilities for each column in `perturb_cols`, where the keys specify the
        column name and the value will be the transition probabilities specified as a pandas DataFrame
        of size (N, N), where N is the number of categories in the column as returned by a single
        column or `pandas.Series.cat.categories`. The index and column names of the transition probabilities
        must be set to the available categorical values. Note that the horizontal sum of each of the
        transition probabilities should be equal to 1.
    alpha : float or int (Default: 0.5)
        Perturbation magnitude. This parameter scales the randomly generated transition probabilities.
        Must be between the interval [0,1], where 0 indicates *no* categorical values of `data` will be changed
        and 1 indicates a high probability of change in categorical values since the computed transition probabilities not be scaled down.
        `alpha` is disregarded if the transition probabilities, `probs`, is provided as a Dict.
    cols : str or list (Default: None)
        The name of the column or columns to subset from `data` if `data` is a dataframe.
    keep_dtypes : bool (Default: True)
        Determine whether the data types of the output values should be the same as the
        data types of the input values.

    Returns
    -------
    pandas.DataFrame
        The DataFrame with PRAMed values.

    Raises
    ------
    InputError:
        Raised when invalid arguments are passed.
    NotInRangeError
        Raised if `alpha` or `probs` (if `probs` is passed as an integer or float) are outside the interval [0, 1].
