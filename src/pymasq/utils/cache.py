    """
    This method loads the cached pickle file of trained classifier from df to self.trained.
    It checks the contents of the file against the hmac stored in the filename, and it will
    not load unless the hmac is valid (Unless ignore_hmac is True).  The key for the hmac is
    stored in pymasq.config.CACHE_HMAC_KEY.

    In pymasq, often the cache file represents a model trained from a dataframe. The hash of the
    dataframe is the prefix of the cache file. The suffix is the hmac of the trained model. Therefore,
    when a cache is loaded, the suffix of the file is unknown to the method calling load_cache(). Therefore
    this method attempts to load all cache files that have the prefix. Mismatching hmacs do not raise an
    exception and instead simply print an error. Cache files that have a valid hmac but cannot be loaded
    do raise an exception.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prefix_path: str
        The path to a cached file to be loaded.
